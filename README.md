# BetterXKCD Extension
Makes [xkcd](https://xkcd.com) and [*What If?*](https://what-if.xkcd.com) have mouseover text as normal elements.

Also available as a Tampermonkey script, see [this repo](https://github.com/SealOfApproval-Official/BetterXKCD)

# Installation
Download the files off Github by pressing Code > Download ZIP. Unzip the file. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) or equivalent (ie, [brave://extensions](brave://extensions) for Brave browser) and make sure Developer Mode is enabled by toggling it in the top right. Press on `Load Unpacked` and navigate to the directory `BetterXKCDExtension`. Do NOT enter the images folder or it will fail to load properly. Press `Select File` (or equivalent for MacOS, Linux, etc) and et voila, it's installed. If you wish to pin the extension for some reason, press on the little jigsaw-puzzle piece, and press on the pin.

# Effect
On xkcd, all images have mouseover text. This extension aims only to make that into regular text for ease of use. On *What If?*, the same effect will take place.
